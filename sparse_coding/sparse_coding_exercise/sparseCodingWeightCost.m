% parameters
%   weightMatrix  - the weight matrix. weightMatrix(:, c) is the cth basis
%                   vector.
%   featureMatrix - the feature matrix. featureMatrix(:, c) is the features
%                   for the cth example
%   visibleSize   - number of pixels in the patches
%   numFeatures   - number of features
%   patches       - patches
%   gamma         - weight decay parameter (on weightMatrix)
%   lambda        - L1 sparsity weight (on featureMatrix)
%   epsilon       - L1 sparsity epsilon
%   groupMatrix   - the grouping matrix. groupMatrix(r, :) indicates the
%                   features included in the rth group. groupMatrix(r, c)
%                   is 1 if the cth feature is in the rth group and 0
